                <p><b>Kristen French</b> is a freelance writer on science, public health and the environment, with particular interest in psychiatry, neurology, robots and climate change. She has written features and news for <i>New York, OnEarth, Guernica</i> and <i>Popular Mechanics</i> magazines, among other publications. Pre-Columbia, she was writing and editing stories about stockbrokers and white-collar criminals. She got her start as a journalist in Santiago, Chile, where she lived for five years, savoring the smog, the pisco sours, and the post-Pinochet revival.</p>
                <p><b>Kate Ferguson</b> is a health editor and science writer who works in New York City and lives in Hackensack, New Jersey. Although she only has empirical evidence to back this up, she’s a big believer that fitness and fun are the best medicine to improve most anything that ails you. She is currently the editor in chief of <i>Real Health</i> magazine.</p>
                <p><b>Roberto Kaz</b> is a journalist from Brazil. He has written for <i>Nautilus</i> and for major Brazilian publications. His first book, “O Livro dos Bichos” (The Book of the Animals), was published in 2015.</p>
